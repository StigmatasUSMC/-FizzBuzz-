# -FizzBuzz-
My first attempt at the FizzBuzz question
The problem was as follows:
Create a code that can process numbers and return an answer.
if the number is divisable by 3, it will be Fizz.
if the number is divisable by 5, it will be Buzz.
if the number is divisable by both, it will be FizzBuzz.
if the number is not divisable by 3 or 5 it will be nothing.
check out my answer!
